## Summary

Anonify is a passion project designed to streamline the creation of collaborative playlists. Users can create shareable links and anonymously add songs, which live update between users on different devices. This serves two main purposes: making playlist creation easier for large groups and allowing individuals to contribute without feeling self-conscious. Further, users can upvote/downvote songs, and the playlist will reorder in real time.

Currently, I am in process of rewriting this project in NextJS and Typescript.
