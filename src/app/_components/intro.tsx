                My journey in coding began in elementary school where I created
                VBS scripts to do various tasks with my computer (such as
                opening the CD drive)â€”igniting a passion that has stayed with me
                throughout my career. I realized my heart is in software
                engineering. I noticed the tasks I enjoyed the most involved
                tinkering and playing with cool applications with little
                oversight.

                In my previous career, I leveraged cutting-edge tools such as
                PowerAutomate and UI Path: tools which my higher-ups had little
                experience with. Recently, I've been given the opportunity to
                work on various projects which have me hone my craft as a
                software engineer.
